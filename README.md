üëã About Me

Hi! I‚Äôm Austin, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer passionate about solving real-world problems with Python, data analysis, and machine learning.
This repository highlights projects that showcase model development, data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive analytics.

Skills & Tools: Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Prophet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Git/GitHub

üèó Projects
1. U.S. Adult Obesity Prevalence Forecast (2011‚Äì2030)

Description: Forecasts U.S. adult obesity prevalence through 2030 using Prophet, validated with 2021‚Äì2023 CDC data. Features an interactive Plotly choropleth map showing historical vs predicted trends and benchmarked against Harvard and AJPM studies.

Technologies: Python, SQL, Prophet, Plotly, Pandas, NumPy

Highlights:

Achieved a 37.27% population-weighted forecast for 2030 (Healthy People 2030 target: 36.0%)

Validation: MAE between 0.14%‚Äì3.05% across states

Compared results with external studies for actionable insights
