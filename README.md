## About Me
Hi! I'm Austin, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer passionate about solving real-world problems using Python, data analysis, and machine learning. This repository showcases projects that highlight my skills in building, training, and evaluating ML models. Currently pursuing an ML certification via IBM, I’m eager to grow my expertise and contribute to impactful solutions.

## Projects
### 1. **U.S. Adult Obesity Prevalence Forecast (2011–2030)**
**Description:** This project forecasts U.S. adult obesity prevalence using the Prophet model, validated with 2021–2023 data, and visualized with an interactive Plotly choropleth map. It aims to predict trends from 2024–2030, comparing results to CDC data and external studies, with a focus on public health impact.
**Technologies:** Python, SQL, Prophet, Plotly, Pandas, NumPy
**Highlights:**
- Achieved a population-weighted 2030 forecast of 37.27%, aligning closely with the Healthy People 2030 goal of 36.0%.
- Validated model with MAE ranging from 0.14% to 3.05% across states.
- Created an interactive map toggling between observed (2011–2023) and predicted (2024–2030) modes.
- Compared forecasts with Harvard (~48%), AJPM (~44.2%), and Lancet (~50%) studies, highlighting data-driven insights.
