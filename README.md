## Projects

### 1. **U.S. Adult Obesity Prevalence Forecast (2011–2030)**
**Description:** This project uses the Prophet model to forecast U.S. adult obesity prevalence through 2030, validated with 2021–2023 CDC data, and features an interactive Plotly choropleth map toggling between historical (2011–2023) and predicted (2024–2030) trends. It compares results with external studies to support public health insights.
**Technologies:** Python, SQL, Prophet, Plotly, Pandas, NumPy
**Highlights:** Key achievements or learnings (e.g., achieved a 37.27% population-weighted 2030 forecast, aligning with the Healthy People 2030 goal of 36.0%; validated with MAE of 0.14%–3.05% across states; compared with Harvard (~48%) and AJPM (~44.2%) studies).
